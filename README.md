# **UX**

Website is designed in a way to ensure an easy booking process & navigation through the content. 
All the sections are precisely separated to ensure clean and effective information architecture. 
Primarily focus is on the storytelling rather then pushy sales to gain trust and business understanding before proceeding with the booking.
Images are playing a key role in the whole user journey as they are the perfect trigger for "holiday mood", and can change a whole user perspective.

# **Research and Analysis Phase**

## **Brainstorming Ideas & User Stories**

The reason why I selected this project is the chance to work with the content I'm familiar with, and also practice some of the technologies we explored recently.
I've decided to narrow the offering and go with Croatian destinations only. I'm from Croatia and I have an understanding of cities and their offering alongside interesting facts and Croatian tradition.
As a start-up business I wanted to offer rich information about all destinations and ability to book a hotel in a desired location. 

**Long term goals:**

- enhancing current offering - destination packages (including flights, holiday programme, hotel & support). 
Potential users can book the whole trip on one website rather than researching each component individually, better price point guaranteed.
- improving search functionality - making all destinations and content easily searchable 
- including checkout processability for the user to fully book and pay for the trip instead of submitting a form request.
- include an online chat to improve the support throughout the user journey


### **User Stories**

As a **First Time** visitor I want to:

i.  Easily navigate through the website - this is achieved with the clean navigation both on big and small screens, and breadcrumbs to easily revert to the previous pages.


 ii.  Learn more about the company and booking rules - as mentioned before, website is focused on story telling which helps the user to understand more about the business and how the booking process works.

 
 iii.  Have a clear separation between services - at the moment there's only one service available (hotel booking) but in future development it's important to separate services in a way which ensures easy navigation and understanding of the
 selected service

 iv.  Have the support through the website journey - FAQ's are a good starting point to offer the support to the users. Additionally, there's scope for help articles & online chat support.

v.  Have a diverse selection off destinations to choose from - at the moment destinations are segmented into three regions with each one offering 3 cities to choose from. Depending on users desire - two of the regions are coast based (generally summer vacation), and the third one 
is focused on central part of Croatia and more on learning about the Croatian culture.

vi.  Have detailed information about chosen location/trip - each destinations is propped up with detailed information containing some history, interesting facts and best places to visit.


vii.  Easy & Efficient booking process - there are three steps to the booking process. Step one is to select a preferred destination, step two is to select a hotel in which user would like to stay and third step is to fill in a booking form.



 
As a **Frequent** visitor I want to:

i. Explore different destinations & activities for my next holidays 

ii. Subscribe to the newsletter to receive company updates & new offers - ensure up to date promotions, and deals are circulated to subscribed users, reward the users who are signed to the newsletter

iii. Have a seamless booking journey - keep on imporving on the booking process.

# **Design Phase**

## **Sitemap and user flow**

Sitemap was created to simplify website structure & decision on included pages - view here. (include a link to here text and link to sitemap)
The tool used to create the sitemap was lucid char.

To determine user flow for destination booking, I've created a flow chart designed in Adobe XD. This helped me to reduce the steps user has to take
to get to the end. - view here (include a link to here text and link to flow chart).


## **Colour pallet & Typography**


Colour pallet was determined by conducting competitor analysis and investigating the most commonly used colours for the selected business.
Poppins is the selected font for all the headings with sans-serif as a fallback. For the paragraphs and the rest of body text Open sans is the used font.

## **Wireframes**

All wireframes are created in Adobe XD. Each individual page contains desktop & mobile view. Homepage specifically has a mobile menu design & destination link dropdown.
Wireframes are saved in PDF file type and can be accessed [here](assets/documentation/wireframes)

# **Features & Layout**

The website consist of 6 unique pages.

- Homepage 
- About Us 
- Contact Us
- City Page
- Why Croatia Page
- Search Result Page


<ins>*Navigation*</ins>

The desktop version of navigation is relatively easy to use with clean and effective design in mind. The top bar servers as a contact details section and the main navigation consist of the company logo, functional search bar & navigation links.

**Search Bar Funcionality** - users can search for two terms "food" & "culture" which is initially a part of the placeholder to instruct the user what to search for.
Additionally, users can also search for individual destinations(current offering) which will redirect them to a relevant city page. If the user inputs the search term which is not stored in the js file the page will return no result found.

The navigation's mobile version consists of contact details, a top bar, a hamburger menu, logo & search icon. The menu expands from left to right and consist of all navigation links. The search bar has the same functionality, but it expands and closes based on a users preference.

# **Testing & Deployment**



## **Fixed Bugs**

**Dropdown mobile-menu funcionality** - when it was created each of the second level dropdowns would expand and would be closed only on click. This caused issues for menu height especially at mobile devices because the rest of the navigation wasn't visible.
To fix this I implemented the funcionality to always enable only one dropdown to expand and close anothers dynamically.
